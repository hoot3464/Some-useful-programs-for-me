# Some-useful-programs-for-me

This project contains some small basic but very useful scripts for me that seriously enhance my workflow in a few different ways.

It also helps me to learn more about coding in python and some of the powerful libraries it has.

Feel free to use these for yourselves and suggest more!

Feedback is always appreciated.
